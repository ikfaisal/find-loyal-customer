    "\n",
    "Did you know it costs a business about 5-25X more to acquire a new customer than it does to sell to an existing one? Not only that, but existing customers spend 67% more than new customers. In short, customer loyalty really pays off -- and customer loyalty programs end up paying for themselves.\n",

    "Companies need to understand the customersâ€™ data better in all aspects. Detecting similarities and differences among customers,\n",
    "predicting their behaviors, proposing better options and opportunities to customers became very important for customer-company engagement. Segmenting the customers according to their data became vital in this context. RFM (recency, frequency and monetary) values have been used for many years to identify which customers valuable for the company, which customers need promotional activities, etc.\n",
